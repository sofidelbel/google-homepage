This is a copy of my Google Homepage,
I copied the original design but it
is not functional, this is ment to be
a practice of the tools learned in html and css.
I practiced setting the
 structure  of  html page in HTML5 format,
reseting the default format information,
lists with horizontal format, work with grids
working with icons, importing stylsheets,
footers and headings, styling fonts,
using Google Developer Tools, and so forth.

It was challenging and wonderful
doing it, I remembered and learned a lot.
Super grateful for all the wonderful people
working in these resurces.
